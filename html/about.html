        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Outside of my research, I have a wide variety of interests. Particularly, I really enjoy sports, travel
            and food. Currently, I am a long suffering Manchester United fan and have always been an avid golfer. My
            family has three dogs (pictured) which means plenty of walking. If I am not frantically typing into a
            computer you'll most probably find me enjoying a cup of coffee or a good pint of bitter!</p>
